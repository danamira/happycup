<h2>About</h2>
<p>This project is the backend application for HappyCUp: the project of group 70 for the course Engineering Design (4WBB0), TU Eindhove. The application is written in Laravel, connected to a database of choice and provides an API for the instances of HappyCup machine to verify/record cup transaction using the defined credit system.</p>

<p>The PWA of this project, enables maintainer to keep track of all the devices and their latest status and whether they need active maintenance at the time. Maintainers can also introduce new cups to the API (and therefore the machines) by scanning NFC chips of the cups using a mobile device (with an NFC detector) on their phone browser.</p>

<p>The app also generates user-specific URLs for the user to top-up their credit online. These URLs will be encoded by the machine and then displayed to the user in the form of a QR code.</p>
